A web game project using JavaScript Library ( Babylon.JS)

This was a web game project for my final year graduate degree. Any collaborators are welcome.
Currently not working in this project but has a plan and idea to make this game proper and more exciting.

NOTE: if the game doesn't load properly. Try it in a different browser or load in a small screen.
